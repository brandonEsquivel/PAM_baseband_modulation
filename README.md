# Baseband modulation in a noisy environment

A baseband digital modulator, a Gaussian additive white noise channel and a baseband digital demodulator are simulated.

# Description 
An encoder is simulated for an information source consisting of an uncompressed text, audio or image file, to obtain a sequence of bits of information (at the source encoder output) bf (ℓ), then an encoder is simulated of channel programmed on this sequence of information bits bf (ℓ) to obtain the sequence of transmitted bits (at the output of the channel encoder) bc (ℓ).

In this stage, a programmed baseband digital modulator is simulated that uses a PAM modulation scheme of order M, on this sequence of coded bits bc (ℓ) to obtain a sequence of samples x (k), which represents the modulated signal x (t). and finally a programmed baseband digital demodulator is simulated that uses a PAM modulation scheme of order M, to recover the bits of a sequence of information b ∗ c (ℓ), from a sequence of received samples x ∗ (k ), which represents the received modulated signal x ∗ (t).
